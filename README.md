This repository contains the code used for the research study of RUL prediction, based on data augmentation 
## What is the project about?
For this project, based on the RUL prediction, a deep learning based approach trained on the widely-used
Oxford battery degradation dataset with the help of generative adversarial
networks (GANS) has been implemented.

Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widely used solutions in many
sectors, such as electric vehicles, thanks to their higher energy density and
low self-discharge. With the use and passage of time, batteries degrade and
eventually die, endangering the integrity of the objects they power.

To prevent all these from happening a “Fault Detection for Predictive Maintenance in Industry 4.0” model has been designed as our project.

### Algorithms used

- Artificial Neural Network 
- LSTM + Bidirectional
- GRU + Bidirection
- LSTM GAN
