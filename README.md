This repository contains the code used for the research study of RUL prediction, based on data augmentation .
## What is this project about?
<br>
For this project, based on the RUL prediction, a deep learning based approach trained on the widely-used
Oxford battery degradation dataset with the help of generative adversarial
networks (GANS) has been implemented.

Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most widely used solutions in many
sectors, such as electric vehicles, thanks to their higher energy density and
low self-discharge. With the use and passage of time, batteries degrade and
eventually die, endangering the integrity of the objects they power.

To prevent all these from happening a “A deep learning based approach for lithium-ion-battery RUL
prediction based on data augmentation” model has been designed as our project.
